Using module abilities raises the heat bar, if the bar is completely filled wally enters the overheat state, in this state his movement capabilities are reduced, he is unable to use core shots and modules.

The state goes away after a while.

The heat slowly lowers itself over time if the player isn't using a core, being in motion applies a multiplier, speed increases the multiplier so being on a rail puts the multiplier to the max of it's capacity.

Being underwater halves the heat rate of modules and slightly increases the multiplier.
