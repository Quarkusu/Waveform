Dr Kubo boots Wally and test his module abilities, he chose to not activate his core abilities yet

Wally passes the Doctor's tests and as he goes to start his Core Ability training the laboratory is attacked and Wally falls in the laboratory scrapyard

Seeing the dangerous situation Wally was in he unlocks Wally's Core 0, Wally fights off the Endos and the robot sent by Machina, as he's about to reach the elevator he gets stoped by a big robot, MkII-Slasher, after defeating it he takes the elevator and reunites with the doctor.

Unfortunately the robots sent by Machina managed to steal the Square Core, so he tasked Wally to retrieve and claim it.
