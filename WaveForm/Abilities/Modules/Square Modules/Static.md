Wally emits a shockwave that puts physical projectiles in an immobilized state

The projectile loses it's momentum even after leaving the immobilised state

The immobilised state only lasts 3 seconds, an immobilised object can't move or be moved.

When immobilized, the object can't take damage or Knockback but it will store the damage and knockback recieved and dish it out once the immobilized state is released

With [[Core 0 ]]If the shield hits an immobilized object it immediately ejects it.

With [[Core Sine]]The gravity ball created with this core can be slingshotted

With [[Core Triangle]]The last hit breaks the object out of the immobilized state 

With [[Core Saw]]
