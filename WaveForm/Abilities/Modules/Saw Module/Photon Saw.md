Wally creates an energy saw that he can use as either a projectile or as something to keep on him.
Even though it's a energy projectile it's still affected by gravity, once it touches a specific surface the projectiles spindashes until it's death.

It's spindash speed is greater than it's air borne speed


 With [[Core 0]] Wally transforms the shield into a a big sawtoothed shield, the sheld spins forward and moves the player at a great speed while sticking to the surface it's in. This consumes a lot of DP really fast. (Only works if the shield is already active)

With [[Core Square]]The saw spins around Wally, just like in [[Stone Rings]], it can be trown

With [[Core Sine]] The gravity ball merges with the saw, the gravity ball gains teeths
